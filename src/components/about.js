          I'm a senior in the <b>Jerome Fisher Program in 
          Management and Technology</b> at the <b>University of Pennsylvania.</b> <br/>
          I consider myself an inquisitive person - I love figuring 
          out what makes things tick - maybe that's why I chose to 
          pursue <b>Computer Science</b> and <b>Operations, Information, and Decision Processes</b>!
          Curiosity drives me. <br/>
          I have a nerdy passion for <b>Deep Learning and Artificial 
          Intelligence</b>. Before the singularity, you'll find me painting, 
          playing the guitar, or snuggling up with a good book. <br/>
